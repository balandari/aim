**Research findings informing this plan:**
@RESEARCH-DISTINCTIVE-WEBSITES.md
@giveaway-email-collection-research.md
@tech-stack-research-2026.md

**Key constraints from research:**

**Distinctive Design Principles (RESEARCH-DISTINCTIVE-WEBSITES.md):**
- Strategic minimalism: Remove what's expected, amplify what matters
- Custom typography: Bespoke display fonts, not defaults
- Warm authentic aesthetic: Cream backgrounds (not harsh white), texture in photography
- Micro-interactions: Subtle animations, responsive feedback
- Progressive disclosure: Reveal information as needed
- NO generic AI aesthetics (gratuitous gradients, excessive rounded corners)

**Email Collection Best Practices (giveaway-email-collection-research.md):**
- Minimal friction: Name + Email only (phone optional)
- Trust signals: Clear privacy statement, official rules link, professional design
- Mobile-first: 70% of entries on phones, large touch targets (44x44px minimum)
- Real-time validation: Syntax check instant, domain verification via API
- Immediate confirmation: On-page "You're entered!" messaging
- Typeform recommended for Phase 1 MVP (free tier, embed on landing page)

**Tech Stack (tech-stack-research-2026.md):**
- Framework: Next.js 15+ (App Router, React Server Components)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens + shadcn/ui primitives
- Animation: Framer Motion for micro-interactions
- Deployment: Vercel
- Custom design tokens prevent generic appearance

**Target Audience:**
- Elderly demographic (Dad's customer base) - large text (18px minimum), high contrast (4.5:1), simple navigation
- Mobile-first (most users on phones) - touch targets 44x44px, thumb-friendly layout, minimal typing
- Oklahoma local community - warm, authentic, trustworthy design

**March 7 Deadline:**
- Hard deadline: TV giveaway during Outdoor Pop-up event
- ~7 weeks from Jan 18, 2026
- Phase 1 must be live and tested well before March 7

  <name>Task 1: Build hero section with distinctive TV giveaway treatment</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx, components/Hero.tsx, tailwind.config.ts</files>
  <action>
**Frontend-design skill active for this task.**

Create Next.js 15 project with App Router. Build hero section following RESEARCH-DISTINCTIVE-WEBSITES.md patterns:

**Structure:**
- Large TV image prominently displayed (hero treatment, not small product photo)
- Headline: "Win a 55" Smart TV!" (clear, benefit-focused)
- Subheadline: "Enter to win during our March 7 Outdoor Pop-up Event" (urgency + event details)
- Visual hierarchy: TV image largest, headline bold and large (text-4xl minimum), subheadline supporting

**Custom Design Tokens (tailwind.config.ts):**
- Colors: Vintage palette (NOT default Tailwind blues/grays)
  - Primary: Warm brown (#8B4513 saddle brown - antique wood tone)
  - Secondary: Tan (#D4A574 - vintage patina)
  - Accent: Dark goldenrod (#B8860B - brass fixtures)
  - Neutral 50: Beige (#F5F5DC - warm, not harsh white)
  - Neutral 900: Dark brown (#3E2723 - not pure black)
- Typography:
  - Display font: Playfair Display (serif, elegant, classic)
  - Body font: Lato (sans-serif, clean, readable)
  - Base size: 18px minimum (elderly-friendly)
- Spacing: Generous whitespace (space-8: 32px minimum for hero sections)

**Mobile-First Responsive:**
- Start with mobile layout (320px), enhance for tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+)
- Stack vertically on mobile: TV image full-width, headline below, subheadline below
- Side-by-side on desktop: TV image left (50%), content right (50%)
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px on all interactive elements
- Test at 375px (iPhone), 768px (iPad), 1024px (laptop)

**Distinctive Elements (avoid generic AI aesthetics):**
- NO gratuitous purple-to-blue gradients
- NO excessive rounded corners (use subtle: 0.25rem max)
- NO generic stock photos (use actual TV product image or placeholder for real photo)
- YES custom color palette (warm vintage tones)
- YES intentional typography hierarchy
- YES strategic whitespace (let content breathe)

**Accessibility:**
- Contrast ratio: 4.5:1 minimum for text (test with Chrome DevTools)
- Semantic HTML: Use h1 for headline, h2 for subheadline
- Alt text: TV image has meaningful description
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements focusable

**What to avoid (from research):**
- Cramped layouts (minimum 16px padding on containers)
- Tiny text (18px minimum for elderly demographic)
- Low contrast (elderly users need high contrast)
- Decorative elements without purpose
- More than 2 font families

Use Framer Motion for subtle entrance animation (fade-in-up, 0.6s ease-out). Keep hero section Server Component (no client-side JS unless needed for animation).

4. Tablet (768px): Verify responsive adjustments maintain visual hierarchy
5. Mobile (375px): Verify vertical stack, TV image full-width, readable text (18px+), touch-friendly
6. Check distinctive elements:
   - Custom color palette (warm browns, tans, beige - NOT default Tailwind)
   - Typography hierarchy clear (headline large and bold, subheadline supporting)
   - Whitespace generous (content breathes, not cramped)
   - Professional appearance (would you show this to a client?)
7. Ask: Does this make you ask "who built this?" (wow factor test)

  <name>Task 3: Build email collection section with Typeform integration</name>
  <files>components/EmailCollection.tsx, app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Frontend-design skill active for this task.**

Build email collection section below hero using Typeform embed (MVP approach from giveaway-email-collection-research.md):

**Typeform Setup:**
- Create Typeform account (free tier)
- Build form with fields:
  1. First Name (required)
  2. Last Name (required)
  3. Email Address (required, email validation)
  4. Phone Number (optional - for winner notification)
  5. Age Confirmation checkbox: "I am 18 or older" (required)
  6. Official Rules checkbox: "I agree to the Official Rules" (required, link to /official-rules)
  7. Marketing opt-in checkbox: "Send me event updates from Antiques in Moore" (optional, separate from entry)
- Capture embed code from Typeform

**Email Collection Section Structure:**
- Section headline: "Enter to Win" (clear, action-oriented)
- Privacy statement above form: "We'll only contact you about this giveaway and occasional event updates. You can unsubscribe anytime." (trust signal)
- Typeform embed (iframe or widget)
- Link to Official Rules below form (visible, not buried)
- Trust signals: Business name, physical location mentioned

**Mobile-First Design:**
- Full-width on mobile (no side margins that reduce usable space)
- Form fields: Large touch targets (inputs minimum 44px height)
- Clear labels above inputs (not inline or placeholder-only)
- Submit button: Full-width on mobile, auto-width on desktop
- Generous spacing between form and other sections (space-8: 32px minimum)

**Styling (Tailwind + Custom Tokens):**
- Background: Neutral 50 (beige #F5F5DC) - softer than harsh white
- Container: Max-width 600px, centered, padding space-6 (24px)
- Headline: text-3xl (30px), display font, primary color
- Privacy statement: text-base (18px), medium neutral color
- Official Rules link: Accent color (#B8860B), underline on hover

**Trust Signals (from research):**
- Privacy transparency: Clear statement of how email will be used
- Link to Official Rules (compliance requirement)
- Professional design matching hero section
- Physical location: "Antiques in Moore, Oklahoma" mentioned
- No spam promise: "We won't spam you" explicit

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile (320-767px): Stack vertically, form full-width
- Tablet (768-1023px): Form centered, max-width 600px
- Desktop (1024px+): Form centered, max-width 600px, more whitespace

**Accessibility:**
- Typeform has built-in accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Ensure container around embed has semantic HTML (section element)
- Privacy statement readable (18px minimum, 4.5:1 contrast)
- Official Rules link keyboard accessible

**What to avoid:**
- Cramped form (give Typeform embed space to breathe)
- Low contrast text for privacy statement
- Hidden Official Rules link (must be visible)
- Too many fields (Typeform handles this, but verify simplicity)

Embed Typeform using standard iframe or Typeform React SDK. Keep section as Server Component unless Typeform requires client-side JS.
  </action>
