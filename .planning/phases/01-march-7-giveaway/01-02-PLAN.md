  <name>Task 2: Run accessibility audit for WCAG 2.2 compliance</name>
  <files>accessibility-report.md</files>
  <action>
Run comprehensive accessibility audit focused on users needs (Dad's customer base).

**Use automated tools:**
- Lighthouse accessibility audit in Chrome DevTools (run on / and /official-rules)
- axe DevTools extension (free, comprehensive)
- WAVE browser extension (WebAIM)

**Manual checks (automated tools miss these):**

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Tab through entire page (/, /official-rules)
   - Verify all interactive elements focusable
   - Focus indicators visible (not just color change)
   - Tab order logical (top to bottom, left to right)
   - No keyboard traps (can tab out of all elements)

2. **Color Contrast:**
   - Use Chrome DevTools contrast checker
   - Verify all text meets 4.5:1 minimum (normal text)
   - Large text (24px+) meets 3:1 minimum
   - Interactive elements (buttons, links) have 3:1 contrast with background

3. **Touch Targets (Mobile):**
   - Test on mobile viewport (375px width)

   - Spacing between touch targets (no accidental taps)
   - Form inputs easily tappable

4. **Text Readability:**
   - Body text 18px minimum (accessible)
   - Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
   - Line length 60-75 characters max
   - No all-caps body text
   - No centered paragraphs (hard to read)

5. **Semantic HTML:**
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)
   - Alt text on TV image (descriptive, not "image")
   - Form labels associated with inputs
   - Landmarks (header, nav, main, footer if present)

6. **Screen Reader Testing:**
   - Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)
   - Verify page structure announced correctly
   - Links descriptive (not "click here")
   - Form fields labeled clearly

**Create accessibility report:**

Document in `.planning/phases/01-march-7-giveaway/accessibility-report.md`:
- Lighthouse scores (/ and /official-rules)
- axe issues found (severity: critical, serious, moderate, minor)
- Manual check results (pass/fail for each category)
- Issues to fix (if any)
- Accessibility considerations verified:
  - Text size 18px+ throughout
  - High contrast (4.5:1+)
  - Large touch targets (44px+)
  - Simple navigation (no complex interactions)

**Fix any critical/serious issues found:**
- Critical: Prevents access (fix immediately)
- Serious: Major barrier (fix immediately)
- Moderate: Impacts usability (fix if time allows)
- Minor: Nice to have (document, fix later)

**Success criteria:**
- Lighthouse accessibility score: 95+ (100 ideal, but some warnings acceptable)
- Zero critical/serious axe issues
- All manual checks pass
- Accessibility requirements met (18px+, 4.5:1, 44px+)

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Production deployment to Vercel with live site verification</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
I will deploy the site to Vercel using CLI automation. After deployment completes:

1. Visit the deployment URL (I'll provide this after deployment)
2. Desktop test (>1024px):
   - Hero section displays correctly (TV image, headline, subheadline)
   - Custom design tokens visible (warm vintage colors, not default Tailwind)
   - Email collection section below hero with Typeform embed
   - Typeform form displays and is functional
3. Mobile test (375px - use DevTools or actual phone):
   - Hero stacks vertically (TV image full-width, content below)
   - Text readable (18px minimum)
   - Touch targets easily tappable (44px minimum)
   - Typeform responsive on mobile
4. Navigation test:
   - Click "Official Contest Rules" link from landing page
   - Official Rules page loads at /official-rules
   - All 9 sections present and readable
5. Functional test:
   - Submit test entry via Typeform (use your own email)
   - Verify form submission works
   - Check email for Typeform confirmation (if configured)
6. Overall quality check:
   - Distinctive design (does it make you ask "who built this?")
   - Professional appearance (would you show this to Dad?)
   - No visual bugs (layout issues, broken images, color problems)
   - Fast load (site feels snappy)

Confirm the live site meets the March 7 giveaway launch requirements.
