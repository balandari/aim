# Roadmap: Antiques in Moore Community Hub

## Overview

Event-driven community hub launching with March 7 TV giveaway promotion. Phase 1 delivers distinctive giveaway landing page (fast-track critical path). Phase 2 builds foundation in parallel (Next.js, Payload CMS, modular architecture). Phases 3-5 expand to full site with business pages, content management, and polished launch experience. Architecture enables Phase 2 vendor features post-launch without rebuild.
