# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated January 18, 2026)

**Core value:** March 7 TV giveaway promotion must work perfectly - email collection, event details, drives in-store visits. This is the launch moment that validates the event-driven approach.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — March 7 Giveaway (Distinctive)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (March 7 Giveaway - Distinctive)

Status: ✓ Complete
Last activity: 2026-01-19 — Elegant business-first landing page with event-driven giveaway section

Progress: █░░░░░░░░░ 10% (1/10 plans across 5 phases)

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Strategic research completed upfront (5 areas): Event-driven spaces, wow factor delivery, email collection, tech stack, scalable architecture
- Tech stack selected: Next.js 15 + Payload CMS + PostgreSQL + Tailwind + Vercel
- Architecture pattern: Modular monolith (enables Phase 2 expansion)
- Phase 1 approach: Option B (Distinctive) - custom landing page with wow factor, not fast-track generic
- Parallel execution: Phase 1 (giveaway) and Phase 2 (foundation) run concurrently to protect March 7 deadline

**From Plan 01-01 (Landing Page):**
- Business-first hierarchy: Giveaway is timely content, not primary business story
- Typography: Georgia serif for timeless antiques aesthetic
- Navigation scope: Phase 1 includes Events, Visit, About only (Vendors/Photos deferred to Phase 2)
- Design approach: Editorial magazine layout, not product ad or flyer-on-web

### Deferred Issues

**From Plan 01-01:**
1. **Hero photo needed THIS WEEK** - Business hero section has placeholder, needs compelling store/item photo before deployment
2. **Email form backend** - Form structure built, needs Typeform/backend integration for actual submissions

### Blockers/Concerns

**Awaiting Dad's input:**
- Strategy questions document sent (antiquesinmoore-strategy-questions.md and PDF)
- Answers will refine Phase 2+ scope
- Phase 1 can proceed independently (giveaway details are clear)
