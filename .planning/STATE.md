### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Strategic research completed upfront (5 areas): Event-driven spaces, wow factor delivery, email collection, tech stack, scalable architecture
- Tech stack selected: Next.js 15 + Payload CMS + PostgreSQL + Tailwind + Vercel
- Architecture pattern: Modular monolith (enables Phase 2 expansion)
- Phase 1 approach: Option B (Distinctive) - custom landing page with wow factor, not fast-track generic
- Parallel execution: Phase 1 (giveaway) and Phase 2 (foundation) run concurrently to protect March 7 deadline

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Awaiting Dad's input:**
- Strategy questions document sent (antiquesinmoore-strategy-questions.md and PDF)
- Answers will refine Phase 2+ scope
- Phase 1 can proceed independently (giveaway details are clear)
