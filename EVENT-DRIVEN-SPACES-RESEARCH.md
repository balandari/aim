# Event-Driven Physical Spaces: Web Design Research

**Research Date:** January 18, 2026
**Purpose:** Inform antiquesinmoore.com architecture by analyzing how successful physical community spaces present events and build engagement online
**Focus:** Pattern differences between community hubs vs traditional business sites

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Event prominence varies dramatically by business model**: Recurring weekly/monthly markets (Pike Place, Smorgasburg) treat events as operational information, while seasonal/special event venues (Long Beach Antique Market, America's Antique Mall) make events the primary content driver.

2. **"Event-first" doesn't mean "calendar-first"**: The most successful sites integrate event information contextually rather than forcing users through calendar interfaces.

3. **Community hubs prioritize discovery over dates**: Vendor directories, category browsing, and "what's happening now" content outrank chronological event listings in visual hierarchy.

4. **Multi-location venues organize by place, not time**: Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg group content geographically (Brooklyn vs Manhattan vs Miami) before presenting schedules.

5. **Above-the-fold real estate goes to immediate action**: "Visit today," "Shop now," "Next market: Sunday" CTAs dominate over future event calendars.

## Site Examples Analyzed

### 1. Pike Place Market (Seattle, WA)
**URL:** https://www.pikeplacemarket.org
**Type:** Year-round public market with 500+ businesses
**Status:** Operational daily

#### Homepage Hierarchy
1. **Consumer action** (lunch, gift cards, delivery) - HERO
2. **Business directory** (restaurants, shops, crafts) - PRIMARY CONTENT
3. **Events** (3-4 featured events) - SECONDARY
4. **Helpful links** (planning tools) - TERTIARY

#### Event Presentation Pattern
- **Location:** Mid-page section, not above fold
- **Format:** Card-based grid with images, 3-4 visible before "View All"
- **Organization:** Dedicated events page uses multi-filter system:
  - Category (Food & Drink, Live Music, Classes)
  - Location (Market Theater, MarketFront Deck)
  - Time period (month/year dropdowns)
  - View format (Monthly/Weekly/Daily/List)
- **Information per event:**
  - Thumbnail image
  - Title, date/time range
  - Organizer with external link
  - Truncated description + "read more"
  - Pricing/ticketing
  - Social sharing buttons

#### Key Insight
**Events support the market, they don't drive it.** Pike Place is a destination first, event venue second. The site prioritizes vendor discovery and visitor planning tools over event promotion. Events add value but aren't the primary traffic driver.

#### What Works
- Clear separation between "explore vendors" and "see events"
- Robust filtering on events page for discovery
- Consistent card-based visual pattern
- Event details include organizer info (builds vendor relationships)

#### What Doesn't
- Events buried below fold (only works because brand is already strong)
- Limited event visibility on homepage (only 3-4 shown)

---

### 2. Long Beach Antique Market (Long Beach, CA)
**URL:** https://www.longbeachantiquemarket.com
**Type:** Monthly 3rd Sunday outdoor antique market (800+ sellers)
**Status:** Recurring monthly event

#### Homepage Hierarchy
1. **Product imagery** (vintage items, collectibles) - HERO CAROUSEL
2. **Next event date** ("SUNDAY" + date, "3rd SUNDAY MONTHLY") - PROMINENT
3. **Operational details** (FREE PARKING, NO PETS, RAIN OR SHINE) - INLINE MESSAGING
4. **Business info** (schedule, pricing, directions) - NAVIGATION

#### Event Presentation Pattern
- **Location:** Immediately below hero carousel, above fold
- **Format:** "NEXT EVENT" section with date/day prominence
- **Recurring pattern emphasis:** "3rd SUNDAY MONTHLY - 800 SELLERS - RAIN OR SHINE"
- **Critical logistics inline:** Free parking, pet policy, ticket sales location

#### Key Insight
**Recurring events become operational rhythm, not promotional content.** The site doesn't treat each market as a unique "event" - it's a predictable schedule. The focus shifts from "will you come" to "here's when and how."

#### What Works
- Predictable rhythm clearly communicated (3rd Sunday = instant understanding)
- Logistics front and center (parking, pets, rain policy)
- Product imagery sets expectation of inventory quality
- Scale messaging ("800 sellers," "20 acres") builds anticipation

#### What Doesn't
- Heavy reliance on photography carousel (slower load, accessibility issues)
- Limited differentiation between markets (what makes THIS month special?)

---

### 3. Smorgasburg (Brooklyn, NY)
**URL:** https://www.smorgasburg.com
**Type:** Multi-location weekly food market (largest in America)
**Status:** Seasonal (closed winter, reopens April 2026)

#### Homepage Hierarchy
1. **Seasonal status** ("CLOSED FOR WINTER, REOPENING APRIL 2026") - HERO ANNOUNCEMENT
2. **Location-based organization:**
   - Fridays: World Trade Center (Manhattan)
   - Saturdays: Williamsburg (Brooklyn)
   - Sundays: Prospect Park (Brooklyn)
3. **Vendor applications** (off-season CTA) - SECONDARY
4. **Brand network** (LA, Miami, ATL markets) - TERTIARY

#### Event Presentation Pattern
- **Location:** Geographic clustering, not chronological calendar
- **Format:** Day-of-week + location pairing
- **Multi-market strategy:** Each location gets map, directions, restrictions
- **Seasonal communication:** Clear closure messaging with reopening timeline
- **Themed events:** Special markets with catchy names (Spookysburg, Come for Curry, ICE CREAM ALLEY)

#### Key Insight
**Mature brands prioritize identity over promotion.** Smorgasburg is so established it can lead with closure messaging. When operational, the site emphasizes "which market" over "when is it" - visitors already know it's weekly, they need to pick a location.

#### What Works
- Geographic organization makes multi-location navigation intuitive
- Themed special events create urgency beyond routine schedule
- Off-season vendor recruitment keeps site active year-round
- Atmospheric photography reinforces brand quality
- Vendor competitions and limited-edition dishes add engagement

#### What Doesn't
- Assumes brand awareness (wouldn't work for new market)
- Minimal "why visit" content (relies on reputation)

---

### 4. Brooklyn Flea (Brooklyn & Manhattan, NY)
**URL:** https://www.brooklynflea.com
**Type:** Multi-location weekend antique/vintage flea markets
**Status:** Mixed (some seasonal, some year-round)

#### Homepage Hierarchy
1. **Location-first showcase** - IMMEDIATE CONTENT
   - Brooklyn Flea (DUMBO): Seasonal through Dec 21
   - Chelsea Flea: Year-round weekends
   - BQ Flea: Closed winter, reopens April 5, 2026
2. **Operational dates embedded** in location descriptions
3. **Vendor applications** per market
4. **Partnership opportunities** (revenue diversification)

#### Event Presentation Pattern
- **Location:** Dates integrated into location cards, not separate calendar
- **Format:** "Every Saturday + Sunday, 10 AM–5 PM, through December 21st"
- **Seasonal variations:** Closure/reopening dates clearly noted
- **Multi-location complexity:** Separate application portals signal distinct markets
- **Related networks:** Footer links to Smorgasburg ecosystem

#### Key Insight
**Operational status beats promotional hype.** Brooklyn Flea treats seasonal variations as logistical realities rather than marketing opportunities. The focus is "is it open today?" not "check out our upcoming events!"

#### What Works
- Embedded dates reduce cognitive load (no calendar navigation)
- Location-specific applications recognize operational differences
- Partnership section signals business sophistication
- Visual organization keeps three markets distinct
- "Team Basil" branding builds founder story

#### What Doesn't
- Limited "what's special this week" content
- No event differentiation (every weekend same experience)

---

### 5. America's Antique Mall (Algonquin, IL)
**URL:** https://www.americasantiquemall.com
**Type:** Indoor antique mall with 170+ dealers
**Status:** Year-round operational

#### Event Strategy (from research)
- **Holiday-themed parties** (seasonal engagement)
- **Specialty collector events** (targeted audience building)
- **Community-based events** (fun, inclusive gatherings)
- **Vendor work events** (dealers socialize while restocking booths)

#### Key Insight
**Events create community, not just traffic.** America's Antique Mall uses events to build vendor relationships and collector loyalty, not just drive foot traffic. Vendor social events strengthen the dealer network, which improves inventory quality.

#### What Works (from research findings)
- Vendor-focused events (strengthens dealer relationships)
- Collector-specific events (builds enthusiast community)
- Holiday themes (predictable annual rhythm)
- Inclusive community gatherings (broad appeal beyond collectors)

#### Limitations
- Website structure couldn't be analyzed (JavaScript-heavy, content not accessible via fetch)
- Event presentation patterns unknown

---

### 6. Zurko Promotions (Midwest USA)
**URL:** https://zurkopromotions.com
**Type:** Multi-location antique/vintage flea market promoter
**Geographic Scope:** Chicago, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan

#### Homepage Hierarchy (from metadata analysis)
1. **Geographic scope** in title - "Chicago Illinois Wisconsin Michigan"
2. **Merchandise categories** in description (not dates)
3. **Brand identity** (Zurko's Midwest Promotions logo)
4. **Social integration** (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)

#### Event Presentation Pattern
- **Location:** Events likely dynamically loaded (not in static HTML)
- **Organization:** Geographic regions emphasized over dates
- **Content strategy:** Inventory types listed (Antiques, Collectibles, Mid Century Modern, etc.)
- **Promotion channel:** Social media appears primary for event updates

#### Key Insight
**Event promoters organize by location, not timeline.** Zurko runs shows across multiple states - visitors likely search by "shows near me" not "shows this month." Geographic navigation trumps chronological.

#### What Works
- Regional branding matches search behavior ("antique shows Wisconsin")
- Social media integration for timely updates
- Merchandise categories help visitors assess fit

#### What Doesn't
- Heavy JavaScript dependency limits accessibility
- Minimal on-page event content (forces social media dependency)

---

### 7. Pike Place Market Foundation Events
**URL:** https://pikeplacemarketfoundation.org/events
**Type:** Nonprofit events supporting Pike Place Market
**Focus:** Signature fundraising events

#### Event Types
- **Celebrate the Market** (annual spring event honoring community)
- **Sunset Supper** (biggest annual event - outdoor dining extravaganza with 100+ chefs)

#### Key Insight
**Institutional events differ from market events.** Foundation events are fundraisers with ticketing, not open-to-public market activities. Separate site/navigation needed for distinct audiences.

---

## Design Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Geographic Organization > Chronological
**Who uses it:** Multi-location venues (Smorgasburg, Brooklyn Flea, Zurko)
**Why it works:** Visitors choose "where" before "when" for recurring events
**Implementation:**
- Location cards with embedded schedules
- Day-of-week + location pairing
- Maps and directions integrated per location

**Example structure:**
```
Locations
├── Brooklyn (Saturdays, 10am-5pm)
├── Manhattan (Fridays, 11am-7pm)
└── Queens (Sundays, 9am-4pm)
```

**Best for:** Multiple locations, recurring schedules, established brands

---

### Pattern 2: Embedded Dates > Separate Calendars
**Who uses it:** Brooklyn Flea, Long Beach Antique Market
**Why it works:** Reduces cognitive load, immediate clarity on "is it open?"
**Implementation:**
- Dates within location/business descriptions
- "Every Saturday + Sunday, 10am-5pm" in-context
- Seasonal notes inline ("through December 21st")

**Example:**
> **Brooklyn Flea DUMBO**
> Every Saturday + Sunday, 10 AM–5 PM
> Seasonal: Open through December 21st, 2025

**Best for:** Predictable recurring events, seasonal variations

---

### Pattern 3: "Next Event" Prominence
**Who uses it:** Long Beach Antique Market
**Why it works:** Single clear answer to "when can I visit?"
**Implementation:**
- "NEXT EVENT" section above fold
- Day name + date emphasis
- Recurring pattern noted ("3rd Sunday Monthly")
- Critical logistics inline (parking, weather policy)

**Example layout:**
```
NEXT EVENT
SUNDAY
January 21, 2026
3rd Sunday Monthly - 800 Sellers - Rain or Shine
FREE PARKING | NO PETS | Veterans Stadium
```

**Best for:** Monthly/periodic events with consistent schedule

---

### Pattern 4: Event Categories > Single Calendar
**Who uses it:** Pike Place Market
**Why it works:** Visitors browse by interest (food, music, classes) not just date
**Implementation:**
- Multi-filter system (category, location, time)
- Card-based grid for scanning
- Multiple view formats (monthly, weekly, list)

**Filters:**
- **Category:** Food & Drink, Live Music, Classes, Family Events
- **Location:** Main Arcade, MarketFront, Market Theater
- **Time:** Month/year dropdowns
- **View:** Monthly grid, Weekly list, Daily agenda

**Best for:** Diverse event types, large event volume, discovery-focused visitors

---

### Pattern 5: Themed Event Branding
**Who uses it:** Smorgasburg
**Why it works:** Creates urgency and differentiation beyond routine schedule
**Implementation:**
- Catchy event names (Spookysburg, ICE CREAM ALLEY)
- Limited-edition vendor dishes
- Booth decoration competitions
- Community-specific themes (Come for Curry in Little Caribbean)

**Best for:** Recurring events that need periodic spikes in interest

---

### Pattern 6: Time Bucket Organization
**Research finding:** Humans think in "tonight, this weekend, next month" not specific dates
**Implementation:**
- Section headers: "This Weekend," "Next Week," "This Month," "Coming Up"
- Events grouped under each bucket
- Within buckets, chronological order

**Example structure:**
```
This Weekend
├── Saturday: Vendor Spotlight - Vintage Jewelry
└── Sunday: Kids' Treasure Hunt

Next Week
├── Wednesday: Appraisal Night
└── Saturday: Outdoor Pop-up Market

This Month
└── March 7: TV Giveaway Event
```

**Best for:** Mix of recurring and special events, forward-looking engagement

---

### Pattern 7: Operational Status First
**Who uses it:** Smorgasburg (winter closure), Brooklyn Flea (seasonal variations)
**Why it works:** Prevents disappointment, sets clear expectations
**Implementation:**
- Hero announcement for closures/changes
- Reopening dates prominent
- Off-season content (vendor applications, partnerships)

**Example:**
> **Smorgasburg is closed for winter.**
> We will reopen April 2026!
>
> Vendor applications now open for 2026 season.

**Best for:** Seasonal businesses, venues with variable schedules

---

## Content Hierarchy Patterns

### Above the Fold: What Gets Prime Real Estate

#### Established Brands (Pike Place, Smorgasburg, Brooklyn Flea)
1. **Brand identity** (logo, tagline, hero image)
2. **Current status** ("Open today," "Closed for winter," "Next market: Sunday")
3. **Primary navigation** (locations, vendors, visit info)
4. **Immediate action** ("Shop now," "Get directions," "See menu")

**Events placement:** Mid-page or secondary navigation

---

#### Event-Dependent Venues (Long Beach Antique Market)
1. **Product/merchandise imagery** (sets quality expectation)
2. **Next event date** (immediate answer to "when?")
3. **Operational details** (parking, weather policy, logistics)
4. **Schedule pattern** ("3rd Sunday Monthly" = predictability)

**Events placement:** Above fold, prominent

---

#### Multi-Location Operations (Zurko, Brooklyn Flea)
1. **Geographic scope** (which regions/cities)
2. **Location cards** (each market gets visual space)
3. **Embedded schedules** (day-of-week per location)
4. **Vendor/visitor portals** (separate CTAs)

**Events placement:** Integrated into location cards

---

### Information Architecture: Event vs Business Content Balance

#### Pike Place Market (Established Daily Venue)
- **Business content:** 60-70% (vendor directory, shopping categories, visitor services)
- **Event content:** 20-30% (classes, performances, special programs)
- **Institutional:** 10% (about, foundation, community programs)

**Pattern:** Directory-first, events-second

---

#### Long Beach Antique Market (Recurring Event Venue)
- **Event content:** 50% (next market, schedule, logistics)
- **Business content:** 30% (seller info, maps, booth rentals)
- **Marketing:** 20% (press, photos, testimonials)

**Pattern:** Event-first, but event IS the business

---

#### Smorgasburg (Multi-Location Weekly)
- **Location content:** 40% (where, when, how per market)
- **Vendor content:** 30% (applications, vendor list, competitions)
- **Brand/network:** 20% (other markets, partnerships, press)
- **Events:** 10% (themed special markets)

**Pattern:** Location-first, special events as accent

---

## Community Engagement Features

### 1. Vendor Relationships
**Who does it well:** America's Antique Mall, Smorgasburg

**Tactics:**
- **Vendor social events** (America's Antique Mall: dealers socialize while restocking)
- **Vendor competitions** (Smorgasburg: booth decoration contests)
- **Limited-edition collaborations** (Smorgasburg: themed dishes for special events)
- **Vendor spotlights** (featuring individual dealers/vendors)

**Why it works:** Strong vendor community = better inventory = better visitor experience

---

### 2. Collector/Enthusiast Community
**Who does it well:** America's Antique Mall

**Tactics:**
- **Specialty collector events** (targeted to specific niches)
- **Expert programming** (appraisals, restoration workshops, history talks)
- **Collector clubs/memberships** (VIP access, early entry, special sales)

**Why it works:** Builds loyalty beyond casual shoppers, creates repeat visits

---

### 3. Local Community Integration
**Who does it well:** Pike Place Market, Smorgasburg

**Tactics:**
- **Neighborhood themes** (Smorgasburg: "Come for Curry" in Little Caribbean)
- **Local talent showcases** (Pike Place: live music, artist demonstrations)
- **Community programs** (Pike Place Foundation: senior center, food bank, childcare)
- **Seasonal celebrations** (holiday markets, harvest festivals)

**Why it works:** Positions venue as community hub, not just retail space

---

### 4. Social Media Integration
**Who does it well:** Zurko Promotions, Smorgasburg, Brooklyn Flea

**Tactics:**
- **Instagram/Facebook as primary event calendar** (timely updates, last-minute changes)
- **Vendor social sharing** (vendors post inventory previews)
- **User-generated content** (visitor photos, finds, experiences)
- **Social proof** (testimonials, press mentions, awards)

**Why it works:** Real-time engagement, visual storytelling, organic reach

---

### 5. Email/Newsletter Strategy
**Research finding:** Event calendars enhance community engagement when paired with subscription collection

**Tactics:**
- **Regular email cadence** for event updates
- **Subscriber-exclusive previews** (early vendor announcements, VIP access)
- **Story-driven content** (vendor profiles, treasure hunt tips, history pieces)

**Why it works:** Direct channel to engaged audience, builds anticipation

---

## Design Best Practices Summary

### 1. Above the Fold Priorities
- **Immediate action:** "Visit today," "Next event: [date]," "Get directions"
- **Operational status:** Open/closed, hours, current availability
- **Visual expectation:** Product/atmosphere imagery that sets tone
- **Clear CTA:** Single primary action (not overwhelming choices)

**Avoid:** Calendar widgets, excessive navigation, dense text blocks

---

### 2. Event Information Essentials
**Minimum per event:**
- Title (descriptive, benefit-focused)
- Date + day of week + time
- Location (specific if multi-location venue)
- Brief description (what, why attend)
- Pricing/ticketing if applicable
- Visual (photo that conveys atmosphere/activity)

**Optional but valuable:**
- Organizer/vendor info (builds relationships)
- Category/tags (aids discovery)
- Social sharing (extends reach)
- RSVP/registration (commitment mechanism)

---

### 3. Visual Hierarchy for Events
**Card-based layouts work best:**
- Scannable grid
- Image-first (draws eye)
- Title + date prominent
- Description truncated with "read more"
- Consistent sizing (easy comparison)

**Avoid:**
- Text-heavy lists (low engagement)
- Calendar grid as primary view (reduces event detail)
- Inconsistent card sizes (harder to scan)

---

### 4. Navigation Structures
**For single-location venues:**
```
Home > Events > [Event Detail]
      > Visit > Hours, Directions, Parking
      > Vendors > Directory, Become a Vendor
      > About > History, Press, Contact
```

**For multi-location venues:**
```
Home > Locations > Brooklyn > Events, Hours, Vendors
                 > Manhattan > Events, Hours, Vendors
                 > [Other Cities]
      > Events (all locations) > Filter by location
```

---

### 5. Mobile Considerations
**Research finding:** Visitors check sites on-the-go for "is it open today?"

**Mobile priorities:**
- **Next event date** above fold
- **Tap-to-call, tap-to-navigate** (not just addresses)
- **Hours/status** immediately visible
- **Simplified navigation** (fewer menu levels)
- **Fast load times** (limit heavy imagery)

---

### 6. Accessibility
**Research finding:** Calendar widgets often fail accessibility standards

**Better approaches:**
- List views alongside calendar grids
- Time bucket organization ("This Weekend") over date tables
- Clear heading structure (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Alt text for event imagery
- Color contrast for date/time text

---

## Recommendations for antiquesinmoore.com

### 1. Event Presentation Model
**Recommended pattern:** Hybrid of Long Beach Antique Market + Pike Place Market

**Homepage hierarchy:**
1. **Hero:** March 7 TV Giveaway (time-sensitive, special event)
2. **Next Event:** "NEXT EVENT: Saturday, March 7 - Outdoor Pop-up + TV Giveaway"
3. **Events calendar:** Time bucket organization ("This Month," "Coming Up")
4. **Vendor showcase:** Featured vendors/items (builds on aimvendors learnings)
5. **Business info:** Hours, location, about the store

**Rationale:**
- Special events like TV giveaway deserve hero treatment (urgency)
- "Next Event" pattern works for predictable schedule (once comfortable with frequency)
- Time buckets better than calendar grid for varied event types
- Vendor content adds value between events
- Business info supports first-time visitors

---

### 2. Event Types to Feature

#### Tier 1: Traffic-Driving Events (Hero/Top Billing)
- **Giveaways** (TV giveaway, door prizes)
- **Seasonal sales** (Spring clearance, Holiday market)
- **Special vendor days** (Estate jewelry sale, Mid-century modern showcase)
- **Community celebrations** (Anniversary party, Outdoor pop-ups)

**Presentation:** Large cards, imagery, countdown timers, RSVP/entry forms

---

#### Tier 2: Recurring Events (Time Bucket Organization)
- **Weekly/monthly vendor rotations** (new inventory alerts)
- **Appraisal days** (bring your antiques)
- **Collector meetups** (specific niches - pottery, coins, etc.)
- **Workshops** (restoration, history, decorating with antiques)

**Presentation:** Consistent card grid, filterable by type

---

#### Tier 3: Business Rhythm (Embedded in Location/Hours)
- **Regular hours** (not events, just operational status)

- **Seasonal hour changes** (holiday hours, summer hours)

**Presentation:** Hours section, operational status widget

---

### 4. Balance: Events vs Vendors vs Business

**Recommended split for antiquesinmoore.com:**
- **Events:** 40% (primary traffic driver, differentiator from aimvendors)
- **Vendors:** 35% (leverages aimvendors work, builds inventory visibility)
- **Business/Community:** 25% (supports SEO, first-time visitors, local searches)

**Rationale:**
- Events are the competitive advantage (most antique malls don't do this well)
- Vendor content already developed for aimvendors (reusable)
- Business info necessary but not differentiating

---

### 5. Community Engagement Features to Include

#### Phase 1 (MVP):
- **Email signup** for event updates (build list)
- **Social media integration** (Instagram feed of finds, Facebook event promotion)
- **Photo gallery** from past events (build FOMO, show community)

#### Phase 2 (Post-Launch):
- **Vendor spotlights** (featured dealer of the month)
- **Collector profiles** (customer stories, their collections)
- **Event RSVP/registration** (commitment mechanism, attendance tracking)
- **User-generated content** (customer photos of purchases, "found treasures")

#### Phase 3 (Established):
- **Membership/VIP program** (early event access, exclusive sales)
- **Collector clubs** (niche communities - pottery, vintage clothing, etc.)
- **Workshop series** (educational, builds authority)
- **Vendor collaborations** (themed events, limited-edition showcases)

---

### 6. Visual Design Direction

**Inspiration from research:**

**DO:**
- **Atmospheric product photography** (Long Beach, Smorgasburg) - sets quality expectation
- **Clean card-based layouts** (Pike Place) - scannable, consistent
- **Clear typography for dates/times** - no ambiguity on "when"
- **Location-based organization** (if multiple event types/locations) - intuitive navigation
- **Inline messaging for logistics** (Long Beach: FREE PARKING) - reduces friction

**DON'T:**
- **Heavy carousels** (slow load, accessibility issues)
- **Calendar grid as primary interface** (reduces event detail)
- **Generic stock photos** (use real vendor/customer photos)
- **Dense text blocks** (modern users scan, don't read)
- **Overwhelming navigation** (too many menu options paralyzes choice)

---

### 7. Mobile-First Considerations

**Research finding:** Visitors check on-the-go for "is it open today?"

**Priority features:**
- **Operational status** at top (Open Now | Closed - Opens Saturday 10am)
- **Next event countdown** (7 days until TV Giveaway!)
- **Tap-to-call** (Dad's phone)
- **Tap-to-navigate** (Google Maps integration)
- **Simplified menu** (hamburger with 4-5 top items)
- **Fast load** (optimize images, minimize JavaScript)

**Mobile testing scenarios:**
- "Is the store open today?" (answer in 2 seconds)
- "When is the TV giveaway?" (answer in 3 seconds)
- "How do I get there?" (tap to navigate)
- "What's happening this weekend?" (scan time buckets)

---

### 8. Technical Implementation Notes

#### Event Calendar Options
**Based on research findings:**

**DON'T build custom:**
- Complex calendar widget (accessibility nightmare, development time)
- Multi-filter system (overkill for early stage)

**DO consider:**
- **Elfsight Event Calendar** (research mentioned as strong example)
- **Time.ly** (used by Pike Place, designed for community calendars)
- **Custom time bucket layout** (simpler, more accessible than calendar grid)

**Recommended MVP approach:**
- **Homepage:** Hardcoded "Next Event" section + time buckets (This Month, Coming Up)
- **Events page:** Simple list view with category filters
- **Admin:** Manual updates via CMS (Dad provides event info, Mike updates)
- **Phase 2:** Migrate to calendar platform if event volume increases

---

#### Content Management
**Dad's involvement question from strategy doc:**

**Low-touch option:**
- Mike manages site updates
- Dad provides event info via text/call
- Weekly sync to add events

**Medium-touch option:**
- Simple CMS (Webflow, Squarespace editor)
- Dad can add events via form
- Mike handles design/layout changes

**High-touch option:**
- Full admin panel
- Dad manages events, vendor features, photos
- Requires training, ongoing support

**Recommendation:** Start low-touch, evolve based on Dad's recovery and interest.

---

### 9. Differentiation from Competitors

**What most antique malls do poorly (research findings):**
- Events buried in navigation (not prominent)
- Calendar grids without event detail (date-first, not benefit-first)
- No community engagement (transactional only)
- Poor mobile experience (desktop-only layouts)
- Generic stock photos (no personality)

**How antiquesinmoore.com can stand out:**
- **Events as hero content** (not buried)
- **Time bucket organization** (easier to scan than calendar)
- **Vendor/customer stories** (builds community)
- **Mobile-first design** (tap-to-call, tap-to-navigate)
- **Real photography** (Dad's vendors, actual inventory)
- **Email engagement** (build list, stay top-of-mind)

## Next Steps for AIM Project

### Immediate (Before Dad's Input):
1. **Review this research with Mike** - validate recommendations
2. **Identify must-have vs nice-to-have features** for MVP
3. **Determine Dad's comfort level** with site management (low/medium/high touch)

### After Dad's Strategy Answers:
1. **Refine event types** based on actual planned frequency
2. **Prioritize features** based on March 7 deadline (if hard deadline)
3. **Create wireframes** applying recommended patterns
4. **Plan content strategy** (who creates/manages what)

### Architecture Planning:
1. **GSD planning phase** (as noted in CLAUDE.md - this is complex work)
2. **Tech stack selection** based on event management needs
3. **CMS evaluation** (if Dad wants to manage updates)
4. **Integration planning** (reuse aimvendors patterns where applicable)
