# AntiquesinMoore.com - Strategy Questions for Dad

**Date:** January 18, 2026 (Updated with vendor feedback)
**Status:** Domain secured - Danny agreed to transfer it!

---

## The Situation

**Good news:** Danny just agreed to transfer **antiquesinmoore.com** to us. This is happening.

**Important feedback:** I talked to Bruce and Jessie yesterday about the vendor posting concept. They were reluctant - Bruce said "it's not different from Facebook," and Jessie wasn't interested in running a newsletter. One vendor thought we'd charge for it.

**This changed my thinking.** Instead of a vendor-focused site (which vendors don't see the value in), I'm proposing an **event-driven community hub** for Antiques in Moore itself.

---

## What This Could Look Like

**antiquesinmoore.com would be THE site for Antiques in Moore:**

### PRIMARY FOCUS: Events & Community
1. **Event Hub** - Upcoming events, giveaways, special sales (March 7 TV giveaway!)
2. **Business Info** - Hours, location, contact, history, about the store
3. **Community Features** - Photo galleries from events, news, updates

### OPTIONAL: Vendor Features (if they want them)
4. **Vendor Directory** - Simple list with booth locations
5. **Featured Vendors** - Highlighted in event photos and news posts
6. **Vendor Pages** - FREE basic inclusion, paid premium pages for those who want custom branding

**Key difference:** You/staff manage the content. Vendors get featured passively (photos from events, mentions in news). If they want to post items themselves, that's optional - not required.

**March 7 TV giveaway = perfect launch moment** - "Visit antiquesinmoore.com to enter!"

- [ ] Emphasize: "Events and news in one place - not scattered across posts"
- [ ] Focus on the STORE having a hub, not competing with vendor Facebook pages
- [ ] Let the site speak for itself once it's live

## Next Steps

Once I have your answers, I can:
1. **Define the MVP** - Events + business info first, or include vendor features?
2. **Build the plan** - What gets built in what order
3. **Set the timeline** - March 7 deadline or later launch?
4. **Make vendor strategy clear** - Free basic inclusion, optional premium pages, or no vendor posting at all?

**The shift:** Based on vendor feedback, I'm recommending we build the site FOR THE STORE (events, community, info), not FOR THE VENDORS (posting platform). Vendors benefit passively by being part of the community, not by actively managing content.

**No rush on this.** I know you're dealing with pain and recovery right now. Read it when you're ready, answer what you can, skip what you're not sure about. We'll figure out the rest when you're feeling better.
