## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Fresh codebase (not copy aimvendors) | Scope is different - community hub + events, not just vendor showcase | Jan 18, 2026 |
| Project name: `aim` | Short, clean, represents "Antiques in Moore" | Jan 18, 2026 |
| antiquesinmoore.com as primary domain | Community recognizes this name, Danny willing to transfer | Jan 18, 2026 |
| Event-driven focus (PRIMARY) | Events create urgency, drive traffic, differentiate from "just another antique mall" | Jan 18, 2026 |
| Vendor posting is OPTIONAL | Vendor feedback: Bruce/Jessie reluctant, don't see value vs Facebook. Build FOR THE STORE, not vendors. | Jan 18, 2026 |
| March 7 is HARD DEADLINE | Dad confirmed site must be ready for giveaway promotion | Jan 18, 2026 |
| In-person giveaway entry only | Collect emails at store, must visit in person | Jan 18, 2026 |
| Mike manages content updates | Dad: "We'll figure it out together" - Mike posts event info | Jan 18, 2026 |
| MVP: Business info + March 7 event | Hours, location, contact, giveaway promotion. No vendor posting in Phase 1. | Jan 18, 2026 |
| "Wow factor" is mandatory | Not "another business site" - must impress with appearance AND content delivery | Jan 18, 2026 |
| Phase 2 scope TBD | Dad: "Things are gonna be determined after that March 7 pop-up" | Jan 18, 2026 |

---

## Decisions Pending

| Decision | Blocking | Options |
|----------|----------|---------|
| aimvendors.com fate | No | Dad: "Not sure / your call" - Mike to decide during planning |
| Tech stack | Planning | TBD during research phase |
| Content management approach | Planning | Simple admin interface vs manual file updates |

## In Progress

**PAUSED at Checkpoint:** Phase 1 Plan 1 - Task 2 (Hero Design Verification)

**Issue:** Hero section iterations keep copying flyer structure instead of creating original web design
- ss057: Split-screen version of flyer layout
- ss058: Rearranged flyer elements with gradient
- Both attempts: PowerPoint presentation aesthetic, not web "wow factor"

**The problem:** Looks like a PowerPoint presentation, not an ad for a website with a 'wow' factor.

**Research completed:** 2026 web giveaway landing page best practices documented

**Options to resume:**
1. Provide specific design direction (exact layout, original concept)
2. Design hero yourself, return with completed design
3. Accept current functional version (ss058), iterate in polish phase

**Resume point:** Terminal 2, waiting at hero design checkpoint

## Known Issues

None yet (project not started)

## Tech Stack

**TBD** - Will be decided after research phase completes.

**Requirements from Dad's answers:**
- Must support "wow factor" design (custom, not template-constrained)
- Fast build timeline (7 weeks to launch)
- Phase 1: Simple business info + event promotion
- Phase 2: Expandable architecture (vendor features, event RSVP, photo galleries)
- Mike manages content updates (need easy update mechanism)

**Research areas:**
- Modern stacks enabling custom design with speed
- Scalable architecture (Phase 1 shines, Phase 2 expands without rebuild)
- Content management patterns (Mike as content manager)

---

## Important Context

**Dad's situation:**
- Recovering from shoulder replacement (Jan 14)
- Answered strategy questions Jan 18 (during recovery)
- Confirmed March 7 hard deadline and key requirements
- Phase 2 scope will be determined after March 7 pop-up
- Mike drives execution, Dad provides strategic input

**Vendor feedback (CRITICAL):**
- Bruce: "This isn't different from Facebook" - doesn't see the pain point
- Jessie: Reluctant to run newsletter - not interested in active participation
- Another vendor: Thought they'd be charged - pricing misconception
- **Takeaway:** Vendors won't actively post. Build the site FOR THE STORE (events, community, business info), not FOR VENDORS (posting platform).

**Vendor features:**
- Now OPTIONAL, not core MVP
- If implemented: FREE basic inclusion, paid premium pages for custom branding
- Alternative: Passive vendor inclusion (featured in event photos, news posts, directory) - no posting required
- Not blocking MVP - events + business info come first

**Reference project:**
- aimvendors folder remains as reference
- Vendor posting patterns, image handling, OAuth flows all documented there
- Do not delete until `aim` is stable and vendor features are implemented
